    <p>Hello! Welcome to my About Me page, here you will get to learn about my background and my present, enjoy!</p>
    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>I was born in Bangladesh, in a hospital in Gulshan, in the middle of the capital Dhaka. My family bounced around in Dhaka for a couple of years, when I was five we moved to another city in Bangladesh, Khulna. When I was 12, we moved to New York City, living in Queens for 2 years. Then moving to Plano in 2020 in the middle of the pandemic, then moving to Allen in 2021, attending Allen High School ever since.</p>
    <h4>Present</h4>
    <p>Currently I am a senior in Allen High, working simultaneously at Walmart part time. I am enrolled in a number of advanced classes, including Computer Science II, having taken Computer Science I last year. I find coding fun even if I am not the best at it, though I find it much better than my other career options.</p>
    <p>I love soccer, love playing it, watching it, watching movies about it, and playing video games about it. Apart from this, I love travelling though I don't get to do it often, weightlifting is another hobby that I love, having taken it up after the pandemic.</p>
    <p>If you are nice towards me, I will be nice towards you. I hate being told what to do. I respect people regardless of who they are, as long as they are good people. I want to continuously strive to become a better person, both physically, mentally, and emotionally though sometimes I do fall short.</p>
    <h4>Why I love my digital portfolio</h4>
    <p>My digital portfolio allows me to display myself, as well as my expertise. It allows me to give a profile of my life and what I am good at. Furthermore, it is a useful tool not just for future employers, but for me to help my peers as well as for anyone interested in who I am and what I like to do.</p>
