    <h4>Detailed Explanation for Sort Analysis Test Results</h4>
    <p>The results of the Sort Analysis project and its tests provide us a fascinating insight into the different sorting algorithms and their usability. But there is a general trend that can be seen throughout the summary as well as in the graph. Generally, throughout the tests, it can be seen that insertion sort and selection sort both perform at similar levels, but Bubble Sort usually lags behind both in execution speed for the most time, for example, on test 12, where all of the different sorting algorithms have to conduct a sort for a reverse-ordered list of 100,000 words, Bubble Sort lags behind the times for both Selection Sort and Insertion Sort, furthermore, test #14 is a trial that both Selection Sort and Insertion Sort can quickly get done, however, Bubble Sort results in a Core Dump error, meaning that the algorithm was not even able to get it done. Alongside this, we can see that all of the sorting algorithms take more and more time depending on how many words they have to sort out, resulting in a clear trend.</p>
    <p>Bubble Sort performing poorly compared to both Selection and Insertion Sort can be seen in the tests and can be very well explained due to the fact that it is a much simpler algorithm compared to Selection and Insertion Sort. For example, test 12 shows us that Bubble Sort can sort 100,000 words from reverse order in 1 minute and 24 seconds, while Selection Sort conducts the sort at a much faster 1 minute and 12 seconds, and Insertion Sort in 1 minute and 16 seconds. While this 12 and 8 second difference might not seem like much on paper, during complex algorithms it can stack up and prove a much larger difference. Furthermore, it can be clearly seen that Bubble Sort fails on some sorts that the other algorithms can get done very quickly, as seen on test 14, where they all have to sort 1 word, Bubble Sort causes a system error though this can be fixed in some conditions, it can lead to much larger problems in more complex programs.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, a trend that can be seen is the increasing time for sorting the larger the word base is, with the graph clearly displaying such, with 10 words usually taking less than a third of a second, 100 words also taking less than a third of a second, but 1,000 words taking almost a second, and 10,000 words taking more than a minute, while 100,000 words take more than 5 minutes and causes a system error, this can be seen throughout tests 9-13 by comparing all different sorting algorithms.</p>
    <p>Thus, in conclusion, the hypothesis that can be taken from this experiment, is that Insertion Sort and Selection Sort both perform comparatively, but both perform much better than Bubble Sort when sorting a large number of words. And, the larger the word base, the more time that it takes for all three sorting algorithms to complete a sort.</p>
