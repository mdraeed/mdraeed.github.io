    <h1>ISP Acceptance</h1>

    <p>    <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/adheesh-katru/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan.</a> - Adheesh Katru <br> I did consider this business plan heavily as the core mission behind this plan is fundamentally a good mission. Intended on making people healthy and getting healthy groceries to homes around the world. But the reason I rejected it is due to the immense competition to the plan due to the existence of Walmart, Kroger, and Whole Foods and their home delivery programs.</p>
    <br>
    <p><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/aidan-valva/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan.</a> - Aidan Valva <br> This was in my consideration due to the fact that Social Media is very popular, and most businesses relating to it are very successful. But I do not see this particular program as being successful simply due to the fact that the market is saturated with programs and projects that do the same.</p>
    <br>
    <p><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/md-raeed/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan.</a> - MD Raeed <br> I heavily considered this plan because I created it. My previous group and I worked very hard on this proposal plan. But I decided to reject it due to the severe software complexity that a project such as this would require, and the fact that a small high school group would not be able to afford this kind of program. </p>
    <br>
    <p><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/brook-asnake/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan.</a> - Brook Asnake <br> I liked the core plan behind this project, as well as the idea. To make a simple program which would be able to help you schedule and plan out your day is a very good idea. But to me it feels too mundane and easy, which is why I rejected it. </p>
    <br>
    <p><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/chris-carter/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan.</a> - Chris Carter <br> I rejected this as I did not really have an idea of what kind of project that it is. I would’ve liked a proposal plan page like the other pages that I could actually view through and consider this project. But due to that not existing, I decided to reject it.</p>
    <br>
    <p><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/evan-bowerman/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan.</a> - Evan Bowerman <br> Similar to the reasons I rejected Brook’s project plan, I rejected the project proposal by Evan. While it is a very good application and program, and could potentially be successful, the software behind it is not very challenging and to make it interesting will be hard.</p>
    <br>
    <p><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/david-ortega/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan.</a> - David Ortega <br> I initially really liked this proposal. I have struggled with mental health issues in the past myself and thus I do find it a worthwhile prospect to help those currently struggling with it. However, I do not see his plan for it as being successful, as even his proposal did not include a lot of writing.</p>
    <br>
    <p><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/connor-church/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan.</a> - Connor Church <br> The way that their business plan is laid out is spectacular. It is very easy for the eyes and I can tell they put a lot of effort into their business plan. However, for myself the project is too complex, as their core plan would be extremely software intensive and not worth it for me personally.</p>
    <br>
    <p><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/jacob-jershin/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan.</a> - Jacob Jershin <br> I did not really consider this business plan as I see it too complex. While I like the end goal behind it, I do not think that this is doable by a group of highschool students.</p>
    <br>
    <p><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/dylan-pettijohn/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Business Plan.</a> - Dylan Pettijohn <br> I decided to go with this project for two main reasons, firstly I was formerly a part of this group and thus I'd contributed to the making of this idea, and secondly I do like the concept of the idea, find it appealing and easy enough to do for a high school group. </p>
